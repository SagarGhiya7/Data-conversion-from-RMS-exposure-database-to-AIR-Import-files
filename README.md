# Data-conversion-from-RMS-exposure-database-to-AIR-Import-files

This is part of the work I did during my coop. R is connected with SQL to execute the SQL queries. The task in data conversion is to run SQL queries for each portfolio along with making necessary changes in SQL query for each portfolio. for loop is used in R to run queries one after another along with making changes. This decreased manual effort and resulted in time reduction by 90%.
